## Data collection(JSON format only)
- [x] Code to collect user submissions of given user
- [ ] Code to collect sample users from different ranking categories - Priyanka Yadav
- [ ] Optimize user sampling by filtering out users which are frequently active - Priyanka Yadav
- [x] Find out what is A2OJ exactly and if that can be used to decide problems -> NO
<!-- - [ ] Can we use the problems in sorted order to filter out which problems would be easier to solve for a user ? -->
<!-- - [ ] How to is this difficulty level decided ?? https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Category92.html -->
- [ ] 

## Data viz
- [ ] Pie charts of problem tags, user rankings(not rating) -> Ambar
- [ ] Histogram of Problem ratings -> Ambar
- [ ] Comparison of ratio of accepted problems to rejected for average vs legendary coders
- [ ] Bar chart for languages used -> Aastha
- [ ] PCA on user submissions verdicts and then clustering. Compare the results with rankings/ratings of the users. -> KShivendu
<!-- - [ ] Use of relation between user rating and problem rating, compare user rating with other userâ€™s rating who have solved a problem with a specific rating.  -->
- [ ] How stable are problem ratings and contestant ratings over time ? -> Ashutosh Sahu
- [ ] Are problem ratings stable between divisions ? -> Ashutosh Sahu
- [ ] Which tags of problems are the hardest to solve ? -> KShivendu
<!-- - [ ] Visualization of clusters of different topics identified by hidden states of the RNN/Transformer based models. -->
<!-- - [ ] Visualization of dependency of problems and topics on one another -->
- [ ] Visualization of how the trends of most popular programming languages(for Competitive programming community) changed over time.  -> Ashutosh Sahu
<!-- - [ ] Storytelling of top coders, solved problems on Codeforces. Can be implemented using Flourish Studio.  -->

## Data analysis
- [ ] Correlation between number of questions solved to ranking of a user -> Aastha
- [ ] Average number of problems solved by people of different ranks -> Aastha
- [ ] Do DP/Brute force problems consume more memory or time ? What's the correlation -> Ambar
- [ ] 

## ML Model
- [ ] Basic model using pyBKT
- [ ] Deep Knowledge Tracing Plus model


## Misc
- [ ] Implement Elo's ranking and verify if we can reproduce the current user/problem rank
- [ ] How well the elo's ranking could successfully judge that a user can solve a question
- [ ] Find out alternatives/advacements of Elo's ranking
- [ ] Use dash and streamlit
- [ ] Predicting if a user wil give up before becoming legendary grandmaster
