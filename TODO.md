## Data collection(JSON format only)
- [x] Code to collect user submissions of given user
- [ ] Code to collect sample users from different ranking categories
- [ ] Optimize user sampling by filtering out users which are frequently active
- [ ] Find out what is A2OJ exactly and if that can be used to decide problems
- [ ] Can we use the problems in sorted order to filter out which problems would be easier to solve for a user ?
- [ ] How to is this difficulty level decided ?? https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Category92.html
- [ ] 

## Data viz
- [ ] 

## Data analysis
- [ ] Correlation between number of questions solved to ranking of a user
- [ ] Average number of problems solved by people of different ranks

## ML Model
- [ ] Basic model using pyBKT
- [ ] Deep Knowledge Tracing Plus model


## Misc
- [ ] Implement Elo's ranking and verify if we can reproduce the current user/problem rank
- [ ] How well the elo's ranking could successfully judge that a user can solve a question
- [ ] Find out alternatives/advacements of Elo's ranking
- [ ] Use dash and streamlit
